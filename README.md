### 1. Overview
This project explores a variety of clustering techniques applied across different types of data, including numerical, textual, image, and audio datasets. Techniques include classic clustering methods (e.g., K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering) and modern approaches using embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs).

### 2. Included Techniques
The repository includes implementations of the following techniques:

- **K-Means Clustering from Scratch**  
- **Hierarchical Clustering**  
- **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) Clustering**  
- **DBSCAN Clustering with PyCaret**  
- **Anomaly Detection using PyOD**  
- **Clustering of Time-Series Data using Pretrained Models**  
- **Document Clustering with LLM Embeddings**  
- **Image Clustering with ImageBind LLM Embeddings**  
- **Audio Clustering with ImageBind LLM Embeddings**

### 3. How to Access
All Colab notebooks for this project are stored in a central folder. You can access the notebooks and run them directly in Google Colab using the link below:

### 5. Quality Measures
To evaluate clustering quality, the following metrics are applied (where applicable):
- **Silhouette Score**  
- **Davies-Bouldin Index**  
- **Calinski-Harabasz Index**  
- **Cluster Purity and Cohesion Measures**
